# MinimalWebApp
A skeleton java servlet app to easily start new projects from!

Simply run `gradle clean build` in the root folder to build the .war file. This .war can then be copied to the `webapps/` directory of your tomcat installation. Finally, run the `startup.sh` or `startup.bat` in the `bin/` folder of your tomcat installation to start the server.

Ta da! You can now view your webapp at `localhost:8080/MinimalWebApp/hello`

Good luck tinkering around and expanding this simple skeleton project to an awesome webapp!
